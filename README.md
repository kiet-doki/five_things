Learning Analytics (LA) involves collecting, analyzing, and reporting data about learners to enhance educational outcomes. LA enables educators to track student progress, make informed curriculum decisions, and identify at-risk students. However, the effectiveness of LA is closely tied to course design, as well-structured courses are crucial for gathering accurate and actionable data. This project examines how intentional course design can maximize LA's potential, highlighting key strategies for educators.

We conducted an exploratory analysis of 38 randomly selected courses at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, spanning six academic terms from Summer 2022 to Spring 2024. Additionally, we report the extent to which these courses currently implement recommended strategies when able to.

###1. Gradebook Practices

Effective gradebook practices are essential for accurate data collection and analysis. Instructors should set clear due dates for all assignments and ensure that each assignment's weighting is accurately reflected in the overall course grade. Even for assignments that may not inherently require a due date, it's recommended to set one for the last day of the course to enable the collection of interaction data. 68.4% of UW courses in our sample use due dates for at least 80% of their assignments.
Accurately recording the weighting of each assignment is crucial for meaningful analysis of student performance and overall course outcomes. This practice ensures that the data reflects the true impact of each assignment on the final grade, allowing for a clearer understanding of how students are progressing and identifying areas where they may need additional support. Additionally, specifying the total points each assignment is worth helps students understand how each task contributes to their final grade, thereby improving their time management and prioritization skills. Notably, 99.9% of UW courses in our sample specify the total points an assignment is worth in Canvas.
To maintain the integrity of data, instructors should assign zeros only after due dates have passed, rather than prematurely. This approach prevents misleading data that could distort analytics results. Finally, centralizing all grades in a single gradebook, such as within a Learning Management System (LMS) like Canvas, facilitates comprehensive data analysis, allowing educators to monitor student progress accurately and intervene when necessary.

###2. Naming Conventions and Labels
The clarity and organization of course data are greatly enhanced by using consistent naming conventions and accurate labels for all activities and resources within the LMS. For example, using specific names like "Week 4 Quiz - Thermodynamics" helps both students and educators easily identify and locate materials.
To implement this effectively, instructors should establish a standardized naming convention for all course content, such as including the week, topic, and type of activity in each name. This not only makes materials easier to find but also ensures that the data collected from various course activities is interpretable and ready for analysis.
With clear and consistent naming conventions, Learning Analytics (LA) can provide valuable insights into how students interact with course materials, assess the effectiveness of instructional strategies, and identify areas where students may be struggling or excelling.
Properly labeled and organized course materials allow educators to track student engagement and performance across different activities, enabling more precise analytics. Conversely, inconsistent or unclear naming practices can lead to confusion, misrepresentation of student performance, and unreliable data analysis. Therefore, adopting and adhering to standardized naming conventions is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of LA.

###3. Integration of Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) Tools
Integrating Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) tools within an LMS like Canvas is crucial for centralizing all course-related data in one place. This centralization makes it easier to track and analyze student interactions and performance. Using LTI tools that are centrally supported and have undergone thorough evaluation ensures that they work seamlessly with the LMS, providing reliable and consistent data.
Maintaining data integrity is vital for accurate analysis, which in turn supports better decision-making in both teaching strategies and student support. Educators need to understand how data flows between different tools and the LMS to ensure that it is stored correctly and complies with institutional policies and data privacy regulations. This awareness helps protect student data while ensuring that the analytics are trustworthy and actionable

###4. Intentional Content Organization
The way content is organized within the LMS directly impacts both the student experience and the accuracy of data collected for analytics. To ensure that students can easily navigate the course and find the materials they need, educators should organize content into clearly defined modules based on activity type, such as writing assignments, quizzes, or discussions.
To implement this effectively, avoid redundant links—link to each resource or activity only once—and use the LMS’s built-in features to categorize and structure content logically. For example, grouping related assignments or resources into a single module helps streamline access and reduces confusion.
Maintaining clean and well-structured LMS course shells is essential not just for enhancing the learning experience but also for ensuring that the data collected is accurate and meaningful. A well-organized course layout allows for more reliable tracking of student engagement and performance, which in turn enables better data analysis. This organization helps educators identify trends, monitor student progress, and pinpoint areas that may need improvement.

###5. Embedding Content Instead of Using External Links
Whenever possible, educators should embed content directly within the LMS rather than using external links. For example, using tools like the Kaltura-Canvas integration to embed videos or placing Google Docs directly within Canvas pages ensures that all course-related data remains centralized within the LMS.
To implement this practice, follow these steps:
Embed Videos and Media: Use the Kaltura-Canvas integration to embed videos directly into course pages or assignments.
Embed Documents: Insert Google Docs, spreadsheets, or other documents into Canvas pages or assignments instead of linking to them externally.
Utilize LMS Integration Features: Take advantage of built-in embedding options provided by the LMS for other types of content.
Embedding content in this way improves the accuracy and completeness of learning analytics by keeping all data within a single system. This centralized approach allows educators to get a more comprehensive view of student engagement and performance, as all interactions are recorded in one place.
Additionally, embedding content enhances the student experience by providing seamless access to resources without requiring them to leave the LMS. This helps maintain data integrity and supports more effective decision-making based on accurate and complete analytics. By ensuring that all content is embedded within the LMS, educators can streamline access for students and ensure that analytics are based on a unified set of data.

###6. Communication About Technology and Data Usage
Transparent communication with students about the technology used in the course and how their data will be tracked is crucial for building trust and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, such as FERPA. To achieve this, educators should:
Inform Students: Clearly explain which technologies and tools will be used in the course, how data will be collected, and the purpose of this data collection.
Align Data with Goals: Ensure that the data being measured aligns with the instructional goals of the course. Communicate how this data will help enhance their learning experience.
Ensure Accessibility: Regularly check that all students can access course materials by scanning for accessibility issues and addressing any that arise.
By openly discussing the purpose and use of data collection, educators can create a supportive learning environment where students feel informed and valued. This transparency helps students understand how learning analytics can benefit their educational experience and encourages them to engage more fully with the course. Ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining open lines of communication also helps build trust and facilitates a more effective learning experience.

###Conclusion
Having the most effective Learning Analytics (LA) depends on the course’s design. By following best practices such as clear gradebook management, consistent naming conventions, strategic LTI integration, intentional content organization, embedding content within the LMS, and transparent communication about data usage, instructors can enhance data accuracy and reliability. These practices create a more organized and student-centered learning environment, allowing LA to improve student outcomes and inform instructional decisions effectively.
